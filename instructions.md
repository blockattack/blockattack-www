![Default controls for 1.4.2](../images/Blank-extended-keyboard-by-Cy21-cc-at-by-sa-blockattack.png "Controls")

Red is the default player 1 key set

Yellow is the default player 2 key set

Both can be changed in the menu

# Mouse/touch

It is possible to play with mouse or touch. Place the mouse or finger on a piece and slide it left or right. Slide from the bottom of the playing field to get the next row.

# Game controller

![Gamepad mapping](../images/blockattack_gamepad_controls-2.6.0.png "Gamepad controls from 2.6.0")
Only gamepads supported by SDL2 will work with the game.  
It is not possible to add or remap game controller keys in the game.

In versions before 2.6.0, an old schema will be used:

# Gameplay

Basically you just move around and switch blocks horizontally to match them 3 or more. Take a look on YouTube to see it.
