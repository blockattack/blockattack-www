Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks is a puzzle/blockfall game inspired by Nintendo's Tetris Attack (or "Panel de Pon") for the Super Nintendo. The game is pretty action packed for a puzzle game :-)
The game is programmed by me (Poul Sander) and is released under the GPL license version 2.

From version 1.1.0 the game play has been changed. This should also make it easier to implement an AI (almost ready)
Current version is 2.0.0

# Features:

  * Based on the classic "Tetris Attack" for the SNES
  * 5 single player modes: Endless, Time Trial, Puzzle Mode, Stage Clear and Vs. Mode
  * 2 two player options: Time Trial and Vs. Mode
  * Puzzle mode has 30+ puzzles
  * Players can use a custom key setup
  * High scores are saved
  * Joypad support
  * Music and sound effects
  * Animations
  * Puzzle level editor (written in Java)
  * Select puzzle file from a list in the game
  * Runs under Linux and Windows + more
  * Save/Play Replay function
  * There is a Debian package: '[unstable](http://packages.debian.org/unstable/games/blockattack)'

# Coming features:
Ok... they might never arrive. But things I would like.

  * Better AI
  * Reintroduce Save/play replay
  * Reintroduce network play
  * More puzzles (always needed)

# Notes:

  * The game was once called "Block Attack - Raise of the blocks". The title didn't make any sense...

# System requirements:

  * Screen resolution: 1024x768 (cannot be changed, but it can run in a window)
  * Keyboard
  * Mouse
  * OS: Windows or Linux
