Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks is a game I originally started to write back in 2005. I was completely new to C++ and if you read the code you can clearly see that there was very little experience before it.

Despite that the game itself turned out to be quite enjoyable. Even ten year later I cannot point to another freedom game that compares to it.

While I have thought about rewriting the game in a more modern style it turned out to be a bit more demanding than I anticipated.

I hope you enjoy playing it!
