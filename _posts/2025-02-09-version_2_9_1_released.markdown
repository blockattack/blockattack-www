There is a small bugfix release for 2.9.X. It turned out that the d-pad did not work correctly when using gamepads.

I usually use a Logitech F710 and while testing I did not notice the issue as it has a "mode select" and the dpad worked if it was in swapped mode.

Recently I connected a PlayStation 4 controller and noticed that the d-pad did not work. This release fixes it.

The PS controller is actually quite good as the d-pad is much higher quality than the F710 or an Xbox360 controller.
