Version 2.1.1 has been released! Read the [release note](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blockattack/blockattack-game/af19221e24dca72a4433bc075f47c785b858eb7a/ReleaseNotes-2.1.1.txt) and [download it](http://www.blockattack.net/download/)

Well there was a short lived 2.1.0 but mstraube found a blocking bug that I had to fix.

This has the first gameplay change in a long time. In the previous version the rise would stop
while clearing. It could stop for several seconds. This is no longer the case. The time is now
bound and will lower as the game progresses.

One change may especially be of interest to a lot of people: The resolution can now be changed. It is a bit of a raw feature. The text is not easy to read etc. But for people that want to run in a window on a small screen it is now an option.
