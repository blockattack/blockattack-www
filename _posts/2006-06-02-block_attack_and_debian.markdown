Not much new. I have received a patch for version 1.1.2 from Gon√©ri Le Bouder. He is [packaging Block Attack for Debian](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=368395). I have uploaded the patch plus the patched source code plus some additions to the Source Forge mirrors. The changes in the patch are related to the makefile and the directory there the data files are loaded from. I hope that the patched version will make it easier to make packages should anyone want to.
I have been working on a new version 1.1.3 witch includes a Replay function (done) and network play. The patch will be incorporated in the next version.
