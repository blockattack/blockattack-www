Version 1.3.0 has been released today! Most notably is that gray garbage blocks have been introduced. Also "." can now by typed making it easier to type IP addresses. See changelog (dead link removed) for more details. I also received a Spanish translation yesterday, I believe it works with 1.2.0 and newer. It can also be found on the download page.
