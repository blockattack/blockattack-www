In the "old days" when you wanted to install a program then you downloaded it and installed it. Today that is not often the case. There are a large number of shops and download managers that takes care of most of the work. From a users point of view it is very convenient. So far I have not had Block Attack on any such platform. Most platforms are not geared towards independent developers or it was too cumbersome to setup. A couple of weeks ago I used the itch guide to create a standalone Linux version so the next step was logical: Add it to itch. I have now done so. I have tested it with the itch.io app and it works on both Linux and Windows. I'll not stop distributing standalone copies but I believe you should have another option. Check it out [here](https://sago008.itch.io/blockattack).
