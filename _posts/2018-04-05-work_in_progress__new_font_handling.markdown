The fonts in the current version do have some trouble. Some people find them hard to read, they scale really badly and they are completely broken on Windows High DPI displays.
I have been working on a new font handling method for Block Attack. It is committed, merged to master and will be included in the 2.2.0 release that I hope to get ready before the end of May.
Until then I have a couple of screen shots:

<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018_04_04_fonts/blockattack_menu_font.png"  data-lightbox="image-2018-04-05" data-title="Menu with new font"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018_04_04_fonts/blockattack_menu_font.thumb.png" alt="Menu with new font" border="0"/></a>
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018_04_04_fonts/blockattack_2.2.0-snapshot-font.png"  data-lightbox="image-2018-04-05" data-title="Game with new font"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/2018_04_04_fonts/blockattack_2.2.0-snapshot-font.thumb.png" alt="Game with new font" border="0"/></a>
