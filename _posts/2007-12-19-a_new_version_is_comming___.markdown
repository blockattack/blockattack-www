I am currently working on a new version that I hope to release in the beginning of January.
It will feature a new Replay format that will take up less space and allow games longer than 5 minutes to be recorded. I am going to move to enet 1.1 meaning that network backward compatibility will be broken. However currently bundled versions of Block Attack is already using the new version.
