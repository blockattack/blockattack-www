Today I have uploaded version 1.2.2 for Linux/Unix. Also a new version of the Level Editor that now can be compiled with gcj (GNU Compiler for Java). I also tried compiling the game on a 64 bit system (Ubuntu Dapper AMD64) and I got a 20% increase in performance, somewhat more than expected, since the game does not have any 64 bit optimization at all (but SDL might have). The Windows version is still 1.2.0 none of the new things in 1.2.1 and 1.2.2 applies to Windows.
