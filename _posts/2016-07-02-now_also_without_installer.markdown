The download section now contains a Windows version without an installer.
I always preferred that kind of installation myself but for some reason I have never provided one until now.
This makes it much easier to have multiple versions installed.
It was Gig that [mentioned it](http://openarena.ws/board/index.php?topic=5252.msg53795#msg53795).

It can be found on the [download page]({{ site.baseurl }}/download/) or on [Github](https://github.com/blockattack/blockattack-game/releases/tag/v2.0.0).
