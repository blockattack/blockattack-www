After a long time, a new version is finally here.

It is now possible to select the 5 block variant in the configuration. This makes chaining easier. Currently not available in Stage Clear.

This version also introduces a new way of handling themes. It is now possible to mix and match in the configuration menu. At the moment only the background, board background, and the frame can be customized.

Thanks to sanchez-gayatri the game is now also playable in Swedish.
