After a long time a new version is finally here.

It is now possible to select 5 block variant in the configuration. This makes chaining easier. Currently not avaible in Stage Clear.

This version also introduces a new way of handling themes. It is now possible to mix and match in the configuration menu. At the moment only the background, board background, and the frame can be customozed.

Thanks to sanchez-gayatri the game is now also playable in swedish.
