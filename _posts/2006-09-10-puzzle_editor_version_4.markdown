The GCJ java version of the "Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks - Puzzle Level Editor" has been released in version 4. It know supports "Test" so you can automatically launch blockattack with the level you are working on (blockattack must be version 1.3.0 or newer). From the next version of blockattack I expect to be able to include it with the windows version too.
