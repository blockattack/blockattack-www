Version 2.0.0 is released. Read the [Release Notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blockattack/blockattack-game/v2.0.X/ReleaseNotes-2.0.0.txt) and [download it]({{ site.baseurl }}/download/).

It is difficult to release software. Especially then you do not have a deadline.
Software is never 'done', it is just 'release ready'.
But I am happy to release 2.0.0 today because it is better than 1.4.2 in almost every way.

Sure it has lost a few features like Network play and saved replays. But they worked poorly anyway.

However version 2.0.0 has better keyboard support, better gamepad support and better mouse support.

It always annoyed me that while I could play with the keyboard, I still needed to use the mouse to control the menu.
Not a problem anymore. Now you can control the menu with only the keyboard, only the mouse or only a game controller or a mix of them if you want!
