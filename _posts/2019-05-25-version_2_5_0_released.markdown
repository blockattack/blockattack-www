Version 2.5.0 has been released! Read the [release note](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blockattack/blockattack-game/v2.5.X/ReleaseNotes-2.5.0.txt) and [download it]({{ site.baseurl }}/download/)

News this time includes widescreen support. Not that it adds much value, as the game uses a vertical playing field. However in fullscreen you no longer get the black bars in the side.

Previous versions also suffered from a bug that meant that files were always loaded in reverse order.

It is now also possible to run in permanent software renderer mode for people who have trouble with the hardware accelerated 2d.
