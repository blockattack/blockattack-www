Version 1.4.1 was uploaded to SourceForge a few days ago. There is not much new in this release, mostly background stuff for the Linux version and I have not bothered creating a Windows version this time. The game not requires PhysFS - a file system abstraction layer. Theme support is also added and at some point I might upload a theme to show that it works.

The things that I still have planned are: New menu system that can be navigated without mouse, lobby system for multiplayer, integrated puzzle level editor and upload of highscores and such. Don't expect anything soon though, a yearly release is still the most likely scenario.
