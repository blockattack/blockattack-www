Version 2.0.1 is released. Read the [Release Notes](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blockattack/blockattack-game/v2.0.X/ReleaseNotes-2.0.1.txt) and [download it](http://www.blockattack.net/download/).

This is a very minor update. It only has two changes: The animation for "Get ready" and the manpage have been fixed.
There are other changes in the master branch on GitHub but they are not yet ready for release.
