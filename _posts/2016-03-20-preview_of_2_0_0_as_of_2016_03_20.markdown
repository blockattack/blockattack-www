_TLDR: There is a preview version that are likely better for you._

The first version of Block Attack - Rise of the Blocks was released back in 2005.
This is now more than 10 years ago. Back then I did not have the knowledge and experience that I have today.

As many other programmers have thought: "This is too hard to maintain. I'll just scratch it and start over". <br/>
However that is not so simple. As Joel Spolsky writes in his <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">"Things You Should Never Do, Part I"</a>: That the single biggest mistake you can do is to rewrite code from scratch.
Rewriting from scratch may give you better code but you are also throwing out a working system and all the lessens learned from it.

So instead I have been attacking and refactoring the bad parts of the game.<br/>
The code have been split into smaller pieces or packed behind an interface layer that I can manage.

There were some things that I had to cut out for the time being.<br/>
Both the old net code and the replay functionality was "hacked" into the game. They had to go.<br/>
The old mouse play function was not done with touch in mind. It had to go too.<br/>
Game controllers must now be supported by SDL2

The SDL library have been updated from SDL1.2 to SDL2. I must admit that I was about giving up several times while rewriting that.

I want to reintroduce those things gain but I'll rather release often once I have something that most people will consider better.

Because the 2.0.0 version is already better in many ways:

 * It has a keyboard and game controller friendly menu system.
 * It runs significantly faster on most systems.
 * It supports international characters.
